	<p>ConnectSafely welcomes you to the U.S. home of Safer Internet Day, an international education and awareness-raising effort spanning more than 100 countries.</p>

	<p>Safer Internet Day aims to not only create a safer internet but also a better internet, where everyone is empowered to use technology responsibly, respectfully, critically and creatively.</p>

	<p>Safer Internet Day (SID) 2018 was celebrated on Tuesday, 6 February 2018 with a theme of "Create, connect and share respect: A better internet starts with you". The day was a call to action for every stakeholder to play their part in creating a better internet for everyone, in particular the youngest users out there. More than that, it was an invitation for everyone to join in and engage with others in a respectful way in order to ensure a better digital experience. See also the SID 2018 press release.</p>
